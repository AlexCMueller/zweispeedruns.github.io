title: Hello! Obligatory intro post.
---

Hello! I am Zwei, and I try to be good at splatoon 2. I main the Dapple Dualies, but have been trying to play other good weapons like the heavy splatling. I have also spent an embarassing amount of time learning inkbrush.

There are many things for me to ramble about about squidgame, but almost all of these aren't suited for textwalls in Discord or long threads on twitter. They also may require revision before publishing. As such, I figured a blog on github pages would be a good way to get some stuff off my chest. I will post as I have topics to discuss and complete writing posts on said topics, but I will not try to restrict myself to any kind of schedule.
