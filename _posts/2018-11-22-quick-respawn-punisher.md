title: On quick respawn with respawn punisher
---

# A brief introduction to the gear setup

QR+RP is a relatively recent gear building setup. The idea is to use respawn punisher... on a frontline weapon. It turns out that RP does not have the same cancellation effects on the user's QR, so it can be run to partially negate the effects of respawn punisher, making it a viable option on **some** frontline weapons.

# What's the catch?

Even if you invest the slots to negate the RP with QR, you will still usually take longer than normal to respawn due to the nerfs QR ate between games. Furthermore, RP also takes a substantial bite to your special gauge, which is awful given how important special economy is in this game. You can also imagine that investing in a large amount of QR *just to negate* the RP effect doesn't leave room for much else. It's a pretty expensive gimmick to justify running an ability that will inevitably backfire in some ways.

# When and why should it be run?

A good example for the use of QR+RP would be the tetra dualies. The build's use on this particular weapon is both relatively easy to justify, and one of the first contexts in which this build became popular.

- it has a poor special, so it does not lose much from the aforementioned special gauge loss
- the weapon's lackluster kit normally deters you from making use of the main weapon, but running RP helps make up for the lack of a good special by hurting the enemy's special economy
- this particular main weapon is an incredibly powerful slayer, and RP allows it to snowball once it catches an opening

There are 2 ways I can think of justifying QR+RP.

1. Run QR+RP as an excuse to use a weapon with a bad special **but otherwise better kit**
2. Run QR+RP as a partial counter to enemy QRSJ

# When should it not be run?

The reason I put an emphasis on "otherwise better kit" in the last list is because that point is a common mistake in gear building. I have seen people attempt to *use a kit with a sub-par special as an excuse to use QR+RP*. An example of this would be playing dualie squelchers with QR+RP instead of the custom dualie squelchers. **This is bad.** ***DO NOT DO THIS.*** When you're running QR+RP on a weapon with a poor special, ask yourself if running the same setup on an alt kit with a better special would be more or less effective. Sure, the kit with the better special will get hurt more as a consequence of running QR+RP, but if it has a better sub as well, it will still be more effective with QR+RP than the worse kit.

In short, you run QR+RP as an excuse to use a kit with a bad special, but you don't pick a kit with a bad special as an excuse to use QR+RP.
